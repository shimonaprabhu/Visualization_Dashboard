# CO2-Dashboard
In this assignment, I have used the CO2 emission dataset. This dashboard is built with the simple skeleton - a very barebones framework for web development as it is not using any of the modern frameworks.

# Requirements

* This dashboard has three visualization views.
* The visualization includes at least one advanced visualization method - **sunburst chart**.
* The visualizations depict different dimensions or aspects of the dataset to be examined.
* The three visualizations fit on a fullscreen browser.
* Legends for each view is provided as well as labels for axis.
* One of the three views serves as an overview of the data.
* Chosen appropriate visual encodings.
* The design paradigm followed is focus + context.

Clone the repository and install http-server module : 
```
